# AckownT

**AckownT** is a backend API that allows users to create and manage accounts, conduct financial transactions (including charges and deductions), and securely authenticate using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authorization. The system includes comprehensive validation mechanisms for user data, military status, and enforces business rules on transaction limits and initial deposit amounts.

This backend service provides RESTful endpoints and is designed to ensure data integrity, secure authentication, and robust transaction management.

## API Documentation

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imansdev/AckownT.git

```

### 2\. Run the H2 Database

H2 is an in-memory database used for this project. Spring Boot will automatically configure and start the H2 database when the application is run.
> **Note:** The H2 database JAR file is located in the root project directory and is named h2-2.2.224.jar.

```bash
java -cp /path/to/h2-2.2.224.jar org.h2.tools.Server -ifNotExists -webAllowOthers -tcpAllowOthers
```

### 3\. Run the Spring Boot project

Use the following command to start the Spring Boot application:


```bash
mvn spring-boot:run

```

> **Alternatively** if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse, you can run the `main` method in the `AckowntApplication.java` file.

### 4\. Use Postman to test the APIs

1.  Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
2.  Import the `AckownT.postman_collection.json` file from the project folder into Postman.
3.  Use the pre-configured URLs in the Postman collection to test the available APIs.
